Below is a list of frequently asked questions and answers.

### Why Do I Only Get One Assignment When I Start the Program? ###
A. The script is configured to only give one assignment on the first day, this is like the sub's trial day. On subsequent days the sub will recieve multiple assignments that will be due in 1-7 days.

### I Did Not Properly Configure My Equipment The First Time I Ran UVM ###
A. A report called RERUN CONFIGURATION has been provided in the REPORTS menu.

### I Got Punished For Not Signing In ###
A. Certain statuses require the sub to sign in, generally every 30m-2h. Pressing the RESET button in the lower right will reset timer, as well as asking permissions, changing status (i.e. Toilet), etc. If the sub does not sign in within this period the sub will be punished.

### Why Is The Merit Bar Red/Yellow/Green ###
A. By default the merit bar is devided into 3 parts, RED, YELLOW, and GREEN. The sub starts with a default of 500 merits in the yellow, if the sub falls too low in merits the bar will turn red, after gaining merits above the default the bar turns green. When the bar is RED many permissions will be denied frequently or 100% of the time. Yellow is normal status. Green allows permissions to be permitted more often.

### Can I Make Changes To UVM and Redistribute As My Own ###
A. Absolutely, UVM is released under the GNU General Public License v3. You may edit the script and redistribute as you wish. Please give credit to the origional author of the script and do not redistribute as UVM (Call it Tom's Script or whatever you like).
